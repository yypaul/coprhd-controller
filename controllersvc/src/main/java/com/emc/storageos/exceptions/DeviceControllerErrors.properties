initiatorsWithDifferentOSType=All initiators should belong to hosts with the same OS
mixingClusteredAndNonClusteredInitiators=All initiators should belong to the same \
  cluster or not have a cluster name at all
nonClusterExportWithInitiatorsInDifferentExistingIGs=A non-cluster export was attempted \
   with initiators that are already exported to on the array. These initiators are on \
  different InitiatorGroups, and hence conflicts with the expected export paradigm for \
  ViPR
existingInitiatorGroupHasDifferentPorts=While attempting an export, an existing \
  InitiatorGroup, {0}, was found on the array with one or more of the initiators, \
  however the InitiatorGroup has other initiators in it. Using this InitiatorGroup \
  would expose volumes to hosts that were not intended to be exposed to, \
  hence this is not allowed
existingInitiatorGroupDoesNotHaveSamePorts=While attempting an export, an existing \
  InitiatorGroup, {0}, was found on the array with one or more of the initiators, \
  however the InitiatorGroup has different initiators in it. Using this InitiatorGroup \
  would expose volumes to hosts that were not intended to be exposed to, \
  hence this is not allowed
vmaxStorageGroupNameNotFound=While attempting do an export operation, \
  the VMAX storage group {0} was no longer found on the array. It could have been \
  deleted outside of ViPR.
vmaxExportGroupCreateError=Encountered an error in export create: {0}
vmaxFASTStorageGroupAlreadyPartOfExistingMaskingView=While attempting to export a FAST volume, \
an existing Storage Group {0} was found on the array with non-FAST volumes in it. \
Adding FAST volumes to this Storage Group is not permissible.
concurrentRemoveFromSGCausesEmptySG=Attempt to concurrently remove volumes from a storage group would lead  \
to an empty storage group. This is not allowed on the array. Please retry the request.
invalidURI=Invalid URI.
unableToDeleteIGs=Unable to delete Initiator Group: {0}
xtremioInitiatorGroupsNotDetected=Failed to detect Initiator Groups for creating lun maps,as registering initiators on XtremIO Array {0} failed
changeVirtualPoolFailed=Failed to change virtual pool for volumes {0}, Op: {1} with message {2}
changeVirtualArrayFailed=Failed to change virtual array for volumes {0}, Op: {1} with message {2}
vmaxMaskSupportsSingleHostError=VMAX masking view with initiator group {0} only supports a single host (non-cascading initiator group).  \
  In order for ViPR to utilize this existing masking view for a multi-host or cluster mask, manually convert this mask to use a cascading \
  initiator group with two or more hosts.
