  The following are the existing mask(s), their storage ports and associated networks: \
    \
  {1}\
  In order for the controller to use the mask(s) for export, \
  the export operation must be performed against a Virtual Array that is associated with the same networks as those listed. \

  if supported by storage system.

  \n\
  Internal Details: {2}\
  Remediation options are as follows:\n\
  \n\
  1. If the extra volumes or initiators not managed by controller are not needed, modify the export mask manually on the storage array to reflect controller's representation.\n\
  2. Inventory-only delete all volumes in this export mask and ingest the volumes back into the controller.\n\
  3. Contact EMC Support for additional remediation paths including a force option for advanced users.\n\
  \n\
  Additional Details:\n\
  \n\
  This occurred when comparing the controller-managed initiators and/or volumes against the volumes and initiators on the storage array.\n\
  This inconsistency may cause undesired or unintended export updates on the storage array that may impact externally-managed hosts and clusters.\n\
  The internal details in this message highlight external volumes or initiators that may be impacted if the controller proceeds with this export operation.\n\
